# Customer-Segementation-Analysis-Model
This model analyzes the banking patterns of customers and divides them into various customer various group. Various processes such as data preparation, data cleaning exploratory data analysis, visualization, modelling and evaluation have been implemented in this project.
Customer segmentation divides the customers into various groups which allows the market team in an organization to target them with specific services or products which would be suitable for each group. This segmentation allows marketers to produce tailor made promotions for it customer groups. The company/organization using this segmentation process provides the following benefits:

>* Identify a suitable communication channel for each group (i.e. social media, email, radio, phone calls, etc.).
>* Identify improvements for existing products or find new products/service opportunities.
>* Establish better customer relationships
>* Test pricing options
>* Focus on the most profitable customers

In this project, unsupervised learning algorithms have been utilized to determine the various customer groups. The unsupervised learning algorithms are K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In addition to the use of unsupervised algorithms, a deep learning autoencoder is also used to determine the customer groups.
